# # Smart Cane Project Implementation
#### The smart cane project aims to help blind individuals navigate their surroundings independently using advanced technology. The cane integrates sensors, GPS, a camera, and AI to provide real-time obstacle detection and navigation assistance.
#### 
	1.	Hardware Setup:
	•	We connected the Raspberry Pi 5 to a portable power source and installed necessary libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, and GPSD.
	•	We attached ultrasonic sensors, including distance sensors, to the cane and connected them to the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi using female-to-female wires as shown in the diagram.
	•	We integrated a GPS module into the cane and connected it via UART or USB to the Raspberry Pi.
	•	We mounted a camera on the cane and connected it to the camera interface on the Raspberry Pi.
	•	The entire system is powered by a portable battery.
	2.	Software Development:
	•	We installed Anaconda and Jupyter on the Raspberry Pi and the required libraries.
	•	We developed scripts to collect data from the sensors and implemented an obstacle alert algorithm.
	•	We developed scripts to process GPS data and implemented geofencing to alert users when they enter or exit predefined safe zones.
	•	We trained and implemented the YOLO model for real-time obstacle detection.
	•	We integrated Google Speech-to-Text for voice commands to enable easy user interaction.
	3.	Integration and Testing:
	•	We integrated the sensors, GPS, camera, and AI models and tested the cane in various environments.
	•	We conducted field tests with users to evaluate performance and gather feedback.
	•	Based on user feedback, we made adjustments to the design and functionality.
	4.	Deployment:
	•	We finalized the hardware and software setup and provided training sessions for users to familiarize them with the smart cane’s features.
	•	We deployed the smart cane to a broader user base, monitored performance, and made necessary updates.
